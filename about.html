	      <dd>
		As veterans of the Chicago Climate Exchange, we saw first hand the process of taking a set of innovative commodities to market. We developed expertise in developing new contracts, helping non-traders understand the benefits of markets, and integrating with financial, regulatory and banking institutions. We brought that experience to the Exchangery, where we offer a packaged exchange solution.
