	      <h3>Overview</h3>
	      <a href="http://howtostartasocialnetwork.com/2009/12/07/virtual-currencies-and-virtual-goods-definitions-and-revenue-streams-in-social-networks/">Virtual currencies</a> stand to become a $5B+ market in the near future. The market is extremely fractured, with various approaches to real world valuation. Liquidity is also vastly different between providers with some like Linden Labs openly pricing and selling currency, to others like World of Warcraft banning any activity that involves the real world purcahse of in game gold. The future seems clear, virtual currencies are here to stay, and they have a real world value. Multiple exchanges have sprung up, but the market is still extremely fractured and essentially in its infancy. An exchange that can provide forex like services to the games industry will provide much needed hedging ability as well as liquidity between providers. Game developers are becoming increasingly dependant on virtual goods as a primary revenue stream, and their current inability to hedge exposes them to a new type of risk. We belive a comprehensive exchange will benefit everyone in the market.<br /><br />
              <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
	      In order to create a successful marketplace, gaining buy in from vitual goods creators and virtual currency providers alike will be essential. It is possible to launch with only a handful of these companies on board, but a truly successful entrant will determine a way to create a broad coalition who agree in principle to a mechanism to facilitate the trading of currencies. <br /><br />

	      <h3>Experience</h3>
	      Any previous position or role that has given you a broad exposure to decision makers in the games and virtual currencies industry. Your credibility and ability to mediate and negotiate will be the most important criteria for success. A general knowledge of markets, pricing, delivery, hedging and risk will be essential, as well as an ability to explain these concepts to games industry veterans in terms that they can appreciate.<br /><br />

	      <strong>[*] Disclaimer</strong> - This is not a posting for a job at the Exchangery, it is a description of what we believe would be required to be a successful founder at a Virtual Currency Exchange. We are hoping to inspire someone to step in and create this company, your compensation would be the equity of the entity that you incorporate for this purpose. For our part, we will offer consultation and discounted fees in order to assist you. <br /><br />

		<h3>The RFE Program</h3>
		The Exchangery is a platform as a service provider, which means that for us to succeed our customers need to succeed. To that end we have identified several market opporunities that we believe are particularly compelling and would make great exchanges. We are so excited about these areas in particular that we are willing to offer consulting and waive a portion of our fees to whoever builds an Exchangery exchange around one of these ideas. If you think that you or your company are up to the task, please contact us.
